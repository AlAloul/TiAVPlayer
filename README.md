# TiAVPlayer
A Titanium iOS module for playing local or remote file-based or streaming audio. Based on AVFoundation/AVPlayer. Includes seek and speed (rate) methods. WORK IN PROGRESS. 

The example/app.js contains examples of loading a remote url, a local file (.mp3) and a live radio stream url (.m3u) 
It also provides a slider for the progress and seeking.  You can also change the speed (rate) of the audio too. 

This is all very much the result of much research, reading, testing and experimentation. So please excuse the mess. 

Pull requests for bugs and improvements very much accepted!
